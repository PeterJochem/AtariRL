# Description
This directory contains code to wrangle data

## Files in This Directory
```createOneDataSet.py``` - This is a really short Python script which takes in a list of csv files created from Chronos simulations and creates one really large dataset of the same format. To edit the list of files to add and where they are located, you only need to change a line or two of the 20 or so lines of code.
