# Datasets 
dset3 is the dataset from Chrono of the foot both intruding and extruding through the granular material. It includes position, velocity, force, and torque data-points over a range of velocities that Dan's robot might encounter <br />

I could not put the datasets into Github because they are too big. I zipped the folder and put it in my google drive, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GkRHntBAKGFLWmFBmqRF3KvPMmSSSJs4/view?usp=sharing
