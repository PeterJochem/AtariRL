# Description
This directory has the code for validating the neural network. I made a directory (```chen_li_paper_comparisons```) for the replication/comparison of the model to the Chen Li experimental data. I also made a directory (```DEM_RFT_Comparisons```) for everything related to comparing the neural network ground model to the DEM data and RFT models. <br />
